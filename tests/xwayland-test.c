 * xwayland-test: Confirm that we can map a window and we're running
 *		  under Xwayland, not just X.
 *
 *		  This is done in steps:
 *		  1) Confirm that the WL_SURFACE_ID atom exists
 *		  2) Confirm that our window name is "Xwayland Test Window"
 *		  3) Confirm that there's conforming Window Manager
 *		  4) Confirm that the window manager's name is "Weston WM"
 *		  5) Make sure we can map a window
